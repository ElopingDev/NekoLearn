# 🐱 NekoLearn — Personal Language Learning Companion

**NekoLearn** is a terminal-based vocabulary companion designed to evolve into a full learning environment for language learners.  
It began as a small Python console app for adding and viewing words, but the long-term vision is to create a **personalized ecosystem** that helps you **track**, **review**, and **visualize** your language progress.

## 🌸 Vision

NekoLearn aims to bridge the gap between *learning languages passively* and *actively managing your growth*.  
It’s meant to feel like a small, friendly dictionary that grows with you. 💬

### You’ll be able to:
- 🧠 Build your **own custom dictionary** of words with meanings and example sentences  
- ✅ Mark which words you **know** or **don’t know**  
- 🔁 Review them through **interactive quizzes** or **spaced repetition**  
- 📊 Visualize your learning journey with **progress charts** and **daily goals**

---

### 🌱 Future Feel

Eventually, NekoLearn should feel like a **personal study dashboard** —  
lightweight, offline, and fully yours.
